# Earthquake Data Visualization

This project is an interactive web-based visualization tool designed to display real-time earthquake data sourced from the United States Geological Survey (USGS). Using technologies like Leaflet.js and D3.js, the project showcases earthquake locations, magnitudes, and depths on a dynamic map. It aims to educate the public and government organizations about seismic activity, contributing to informed decision-making and awareness.

## Features

### **Core Features**
- **Interactive Map**: Displays earthquake data dynamically on a responsive map.
- **Dynamic Markers**: Marker size corresponds to earthquake magnitude, and color represents depth.
- **Informative Popups**: Each marker includes detailed information, such as magnitude, location, and depth.
- **Legend**: Provides a clear reference for depth color coding.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Core programming language for logic and interaction.
- **HTML/CSS**: For structuring and styling the application.
- **Leaflet.js**: A library for creating interactive maps.
- **D3.js**: For fetching and handling GeoJSON data dynamically.
- **GeoJSON**: Format for earthquake data sourced from USGS.
